# Tic-Tac-Toe

A project to practice working with factory functions in JavaScript. This project was created for the Full Stack JavaScript course in The Odin Project.

The game requires two players. At the start, you are presented with an empty 3x3 grid. Player One can click one of the empty squares of the grid to begin a game, which will mark the square with an "X". Player Two then follows, marking an empty square of their choice with an "O", and so on until one player gets three-in-a-row or all the squares have been marked. 

At the end of a game, a new game can be started by pressing the "New Game" button, or by having Player One click on one of the game board squares to mark their first choice. Wins are tracked between games on the scoreboard next to the grid.
